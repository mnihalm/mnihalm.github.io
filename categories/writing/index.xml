      <description>When I told my friend hours before i started making this blog, She asked - &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the first post gonna be about?&amp;rdquo;. On any other day, this innocent question would&amp;rsquo;ve made me think, quite a bit, until the thought of the ideal, perfect &amp;lsquo;first post&amp;rsquo; consumed all thought space until the wandering mind settled on the next shiny thing.
Today was different though. Having lazed away over half a day, I decided that I shall finish setting up the blog.</description>
